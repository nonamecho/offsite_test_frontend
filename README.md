Fare Rules and Remarks  
For itineraries involving multiple carriers, the most restrictive fare rule will apply to the entire booking.
Fare Remarks:
Passenger taking a connect flight at China must pay attention to and ensure that they can meet the new requirements (e.g. quarantine arrangement and/or a valid proof of a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result within 24 hours) at the transit airport to avoid hiccups when crossing the border.Regarding to the latest development of COVID-19 in different countries, we recommend passengers to check on the latest airport policy for the transit airport and the entry restriction of the final destination before purchasing flight tickets. 
Passenger must hold a valid multiple entry Chinese Visa or China re-entry permit
